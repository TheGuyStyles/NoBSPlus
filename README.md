# NoBSPlus
A browser extension for the NoBS crypto spreadsheet.

* Row Highlighter for hover and click with customizable rgba color, and the ability to save a favorite color.
* Encrypted and local storage saved portfolio opened by clicking on coin names.
* CryptoCompare support to display current market prices.
* Search by metrics to display coins selected by a single or multiple specific metrics.
* Further information can be accessed from the NoBSPlus Menu on the top right of the NoBS Crypto Spreadsheet.

Permissions are for the actual NoBS Crypto Spreadsheet found at: [NoBS Crypto](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/e/2PACX-1vTaQSEXx7nayY6FJ8O4icWjTKhQGG4Oup8L7lDy7Pb5oLa2Y-Bv-c_MyFa7kVomltx_aOBw-caJoq47/pubhtml) and for the CryptoCompare API.
The extension should only be active when on the spreadsheet.

This is WIP currently being worked on by Guy Styles and Loshcat.
